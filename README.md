# NitrogenPollutionModeling
Exploratory collaborative project to build pre-processing workflows into jupyter notebook for non-point nitrogen pollution modeling. 

Our project is related to the nitrogen modeling case study paper by Shook, Merson, and Wentz: "Network Flow Algebra for Modelling Non-Point Source Pollution: A Case Study in Niantic Watershed, Connecticut" (2018, in review). Their method of non-point pollution nitrogen modeling utilized network flow algebra to create a more efficient modeling techniqe that only counts the net flow path from the nitrogen source to sink. Their method of reach reduction allows the program to not have to calculate from the pollution source, to non-source, to sink. Our goal is to use a Jupyter Notebook to add widgets that allow users to modify the input data and receive a shapefile of flow paths with accumulated nitrogen flow attributed. In the original work, the nitrogen load values are set in the stream flow shapefile based on land use NLCD values. For our modification of the original code, the user will be able to use a sliding scale widget to decide how much nitrogen (or other pollutant, potentially) will be associated with land use types that are sources for non-point pollution.
